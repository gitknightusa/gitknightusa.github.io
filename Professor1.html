                <h2>Dr. Edward Soja</h2>
                <p>
                    was a self-described "urbanist,"[1] a noted postmodern political geographer and urban theorist on the planning faculty at UCLA, 
                    where he was Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning, and the London School of Economics. He has a Ph.D. from Syracuse University. 
                    His early research focused on planning in Kenya, but Soja came to be known as the world's leading spatial theorist with a distingusihed 
                    career writing on spatial formations and social justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015 he was awarded the Vautrin Lud Prize, which is the highest honor for a geographer and often called the Nobel Prize in the field of geography
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to his readings of American feminist cultural theorist bell hooks (b. 1952), and French intellectual Michel Foucault (1926–1984), 
                    Soja's greatest contribution to spatial theory and the field of cultural geography is his use of the work of French Marxist urban sociologist 
                    Henri Lefebvre (1901–1991), author of The Production of Space (1974). Soja has updated Lefebvre's concept of the spatial triad with his own 
                    concept of spatial trialectics which includes thirdspace, or spaces that are both real and imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soja focuses his critical postmodern analysis of space and society, or what he calls spatiality, on the people and places of Los Angeles. 
                    In 2010 the University of Minnesota Press released his recent work on spatial justice,[2] which was followed in 2014 with his newest book 
                    "My Los Angeles" published by the University of California Press
                </p>

                <h3>Vision:</h3>
                <p>
                    Soja has introduced six visions for the City of Los Angeles.[12] These are the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flexicity: Deindustrialization has been occurring alongside a potent reindustrialization process built not just on high technology.</li> 
                        <li>Cosmopolis: The primacy of globalization. Globalization of culture, labor and capital. Reworlds the city.</li>
                        <li>Exopolis: The city that no longer conveys the traditional qualities of cityness. No cityness about Los Angeles. Growth of the outer city and city edges. More urban life.</li>
                        <li>Metropolarities: Increasing social inequalities, widening income gaps, new kinds of social polarization and satisfaction that fit uncomfortably within traditional dualisms based on class or race, as well as conventional. New underclass debate.</li>
                        <li>Carcereal Archipielagos: A fortified city with bulging prisons. The City of Quartz. More surveillance.</li>
                        <li>Simcity: A place where simulations of a presumably real world increasingly capture and activate our urban imaginary and infiltrate everything urban life. An electronic generation of hyper reality.</li>
                    </ul>
