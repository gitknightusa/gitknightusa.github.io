                    <h3> Description </h3>
                    <p>
                        The centrality of cities to an understanding of historic societies is an assumption shared by most urbanists but it is scarcely 
                        evident in the work of other social analysts. It is still possible to write or compile contemporary histories that allot, at best, 
                        a chapter to urban phenomena. This may not be because the other social analysts are being obtuse but rather because urbanists have, 
                        in the main, not made an adequate case for that centrality. Among the few that have made such a case Edward Soja's work is 
                        particularly distinctive. As was noted in an earlier discussion of aspects of his work, Soja's trilogy - Postmodern 
                        Geographies (1989), Thirdspace (1996) and Postmetropolis (2000) - is 'an exciting enterprise, superbly written, showing great 
                        insight and increasing catholicity and generosity towards a wide range of work' (Catterall, 'It All Came Together in New York? 
                        Urban Studies and the Present Crisis', CITY, Vol.6, No.1, 2002). But it is more than that. It is a reconceptualisation of the 
                        field that puts it in touch with and contributes to the recasting of contemporary, transdisciplinary social analysis. It includes, 
                        as his personal introduction below to key aspects of his work indicates: a rejection of binary divisions that set, for example, 
                        Marxist and postmodern approaches apart; an emphasis on and exploration of the notion of synekism (the stimulus of urban agglomeration), 
                        and of the essential spatiality of urban phenomena; and - unexpectedly, for those still coming to terms with the spatial turn - 
                        a related reconsideration of urban history (including a prequel of 5,000 years added to, and necessitating the rethinking of 
                        the established account of, 'the Urban Revolution').

                    <p>
                        Dr. Edward Soja
                        was a self-described "urbanist,"[1] a noted postmodern political geographer and urban theorist on the planning faculty at UCLA, where he was Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning, and the London School of Economics. He has a Ph.D. from Syracuse University. His early research focused on planning in Kenya, but Soja came to be known as the world's leading spatial theorist with a distingusihed career writing on spatial formations and social justice.

                        In 2015 he was awarded the Vautrin Lud Prize, which is the highest honor for a geographer and often called the Nobel Prize in the field of geography

                        In addition to his readings of American feminist cultural theorist bell hooks (b. 1952), and French intellectual Michel Foucault (1926–1984), Soja's greatest contribution to spatial theory and the field of cultural geography is his use of the work of French Marxist urban sociologist Henri Lefebvre (1901–1991), author of The Production of Space (1974). Soja has updated Lefebvre's concept of the spatial triad with his own concept of spatial trialectics which includes thirdspace, or spaces that are both real and imagined.

                        Soja focuses his critical postmodern analysis of space and society, or what he calls spatiality, on the people and places of Los Angeles. In 2010 the University of Minnesota Press released his recent work on spatial justice,[2] which was followed in 2014 with his newest book "My Los Angeles" published by the University of California Press
