                        The broadest answer reflects a remarkable if not widely recognized event that began in Paris after 1968: the first stirrings, mainly in the work of Lefebvre and Foucault, of what would eventually—after more than 20 years of neglect– become called the Spatial Turn. A resurgence of interest in space and spatial thinking has been occurring over the last several decades, spreading a spatial concept and awareness to every discipline. Today, more than in any other time in at least the last two hundred years, spatial thinking has become transdisciplinary, adopted in various ways in almost every subject area. For many disciplines -outside geography, architecture, urbanism- spatial thinking is very new. And so what we are seeing today is a kind of initial exploration about how spatial thinking, in a wide variety of subject areas, from religion to archeology to anthropology and accounting, can open up new possibilities, new insights

                        Dr. Edward Soja
                        was a self-described "urbanist,"[1] a noted postmodern political geographer and urban theorist on the planning faculty at UCLA, where he was Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning, and the London School of Economics. He has a Ph.D. from Syracuse University. His early research focused on planning in Kenya, but Soja came to be known as the world's leading spatial theorist with a distingusihed career writing on spatial formations and social justice.

                        In 2015 he was awarded the Vautrin Lud Prize, which is the highest honor for a geographer and often called the Nobel Prize in the field of geography

                        In addition to his readings of American feminist cultural theorist bell hooks (b. 1952), and French intellectual Michel Foucault (1926–1984), Soja's greatest contribution to spatial theory and the field of cultural geography is his use of the work of French Marxist urban sociologist Henri Lefebvre (1901–1991), author of The Production of Space (1974). Soja has updated Lefebvre's concept of the spatial triad with his own concept of spatial trialectics which includes thirdspace, or spaces that are both real and imagined.

                        Soja focuses his critical postmodern analysis of space and society, or what he calls spatiality, on the people and places of Los Angeles. In 2010 the University of Minnesota Press released his recent work on spatial justice,[2] which was followed in 2014 with his newest book "My Los Angeles" published by the University of California Press

                        Another more specific reason for emphasizing spatial justice came from the writing of Postmetropolis and partly explains why it took me ten years to write Seeking Spatial Justice. When I was completing Postmetropolis, which emphasizes what has been happening to cities over the last 30 or 40 years, I realized that the picture I was painting of the contemporary urban condition seemed very depressing and dark.  Urban restructuring had produced so many negative outcomes that one ended up with almost no hope for any possibility for a better future. And so at the very end of Postmetropolis, I started speaking about spatial justice and the possibilities of using explicitly spatial strategies to address in new ways the enormous inequalities and injustices that had been generated by nearly four decades of economic restructuring and neoliberal globalization. Seeking spatial justice became for me a source of hope for the future, a new direction for urban social movements in the 21st century.
