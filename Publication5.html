                        What does it mean to dwell? Every civilization has a story to tell, according to Anne Buttimer, and exploring those stories brings fresh light to modern ideas about the relationship between humanity and its environment. In Geography and the Human Spirit, Buttimer ranges widely from Plato to Barry Lopez, from the Upanishads to Goethe, taking an interdisciplinary look at the ways in which human beings have turned to natural science, theology, and myth to form visions of the earth as a human habitat.Geography and the Human Spirit is a pilgrimage into the workings of one of geography's most conceptual and yet focused thinkers.

                        (Landscape Journal)

                        Not only represents a comprehensive survey of the history of Western humanism, but also offers a series of important challenges for all geographers to consider.

                        (Tim Unwin Geographical Journal)

                        A vitally creative and imaginative effort to parse meanings associated with geography and the human spirit.

                        (Professional Geographer)

                        This book will be widely recognized as a landmark in geographical scholarship.

                        (David M. Smith Ecumene)

                        This is an original and complex piece of work in the history of geographic and humanistic thought. It brings back the forgotten excitement of intellectual adventure. It is, in short, a tour de force of scholarship.

                    <p>
                        Buttimer grew up in Ireland with strong Catholic convictions. She studied at University College Cork (BA, geography, Latin and mathematics 1957) and the National University of Ireland (master's in geography, 1959). After this, she joined the Dominican Order and moved to Seattle. She remained in the order for 17 years.[1] Her PhD in geography was from the University of Washington in 1965 and concerned conceptual and methodological foundations for social geography.[2] She was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Louvain and from 1966 to 1968 worked as an assistant professor at the University of Seattle. She spent two years at the University of Glasgow working in the social geography of housing, before joining Clark University from 1970–1981 where she firmly established a reputation as a social geographer and social scientist. In 1982 she was based in Lund as a research fellow of the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Sciences, then briefly a professor at the Université d'Ottawa (1989–91) before moving to University College Dublin 1991–2003. A multilingual scholar (English, Gaelic, French, Latin, Swedish...?), she has also held numerous short-term positions in Europe.
