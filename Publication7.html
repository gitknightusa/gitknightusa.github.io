                <h2>Making of Geography in Sweden</h2>

                    <h3> Description </h3>
                    <p>
                        'For the last half century, Sweden has been a global epicentre for stirring up innovation waves in human geography. For any one who wants to understand the deep roots of the "Swedish phenomenon", this thoughtful book by Buttimer and Mels - with unique contributions by the late Torsten Hagerstrand - is a must.' Peter Haggett, University of Bristol, UK 'Rooted in the meeting and blending of two of the most brilliant and influential minds in geography of the last half century, this opus is nothing less than a path-breaking post-disciplinary history of a discipline - a masterpiece in the contextual analysis of the geohistory of thought. It links the making of geography as discipline to the making of geographies in the real world, packed with matter and meaning, the places in which we make our lives. Fascinating, refreshing, in places exciting, this book deserves a much wider audience than geographers and historians of science. The challenging vista it opens up to paths ahead should interest everyone concerned about the role of science in navigating our common future.' Eric Clark, Lund University, Sweden 'This is a wonderfully expressive history of a discipline in its context...fascinating, illuminating and inspiring. As an intellectual history of the development of the discipline of geography in the context of its Swedish time and its Swedish place, it is superb.' Geography 'During the past decades some books and a number of articles...dealing with the history and development of geography in Sweden have been published, but the book under review is without doubt penetrating geography in Sweden in a deeper and more profiled way than the other publications...It contributes new knowledge on the general subject of geographical thought and the special subject of the making of geography in Sweden. The authors have managed to produce a qualified and interesting book.' Geografiska Annaler B: Human Geography '...By Northern Lights provides a detailed account of the history of Swedish geography, which has been long-overdue and should long stand as a reference not only on geography in Sweden but the practice of the historiography of geography.' Cultural geographies 'I have no doubt that this book should be of great interest to any geographer interested in the intellectual history of the discipline.' Area

                    <p>
                        Buttimer grew up in Ireland with strong Catholic convictions. She studied at University College Cork (BA, geography, Latin and mathematics 1957) and the National University of Ireland (master's in geography, 1959). After this, she joined the Dominican Order and moved to Seattle. She remained in the order for 17 years.[1] Her PhD in geography was from the University of Washington in 1965 and concerned conceptual and methodological foundations for social geography.[2] She was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Louvain and from 1966 to 1968 worked as an assistant professor at the University of Seattle. She spent two years at the University of Glasgow working in the social geography of housing, before joining Clark University from 1970–1981 where she firmly established a reputation as a social geographer and social scientist. In 1982 she was based in Lund as a research fellow of the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Sciences, then briefly a professor at the Université d'Ottawa (1989–91) before moving to University College Dublin 1991–2003. A multilingual scholar (English, Gaelic, French, Latin, Swedish...?), she has also held numerous short-term positions in Europe.
