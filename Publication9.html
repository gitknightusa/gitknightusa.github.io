                    <p>
                        This is a review article of Kristen Rundle, Forms Liberate. Reclaiming the Jurisprudence of Lon L Fuller, and Jutta Brunnée & Stephen John Toope, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law. An Interactional Account. It puts both books in perspective, in the context of a modest Fuller revival since 1994.

                        Rundle successfully tries to reclaim Fuller from the distorted picture that arose in the wake of the Hart-Fuller debate. According to Rundle, Fuller’s most important and still highly relevant message is that we should take the form of law seriously. There is a connection between the form of law and how law approaches human agency. Rundle relies extensively on unpublished materials from the Fuller archives. This was a fortunate choice, because in those materials Fuller was often franker and clearer than in the published materials.

                        An interesting application of Fuller’s work is found in the field of international law, which has always been the Achilles heel of legal positivism. Jutta Brunnée and Stephen Toope have elaborated and adapted the Fullerian framework so that it provides an adequate theory of international law. In my view, they have provided a highly convincing account of the emergence of international law.

                        Buttimer grew up in Ireland with strong Catholic convictions. She studied at University College Cork (BA, geography, Latin and mathematics 1957) and the National University of Ireland (master's in geography, 1959). After this, she joined the Dominican Order and moved to Seattle. She remained in the order for 17 years.[1] Her PhD in geography was from the University of Washington in 1965 and concerned conceptual and methodological foundations for social geography.[2] She was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Louvain and from 1966 to 1968 worked as an assistant professor at the University of Seattle. She spent two years at the University of Glasgow working in the social geography of housing, before joining Clark University from 1970–1981 where she firmly established a reputation as a social geographer and social scientist. In 1982 she was based in Lund as a research fellow of the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Sciences, then briefly a professor at the Université d'Ottawa (1989–91) before moving to University College Dublin 1991–2003. A multilingual scholar (English, Gaelic, French, Latin, Swedish...?), she has also held numerous short-term positions in Europe.
